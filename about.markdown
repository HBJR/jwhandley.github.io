I am a third year undergraduate at Merton College, Oxford studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.

I was born in California and, after living there for most of the first 16 years of my life, I moved to Japan with my parents to finish high school before coming to the UK for university.

My main interests are political sociology, political economy, and social policy. I made this blog to showcase some of my personal side projects, especially data analysis and visualisation skills with Python and R.
